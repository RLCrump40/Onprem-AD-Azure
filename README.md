<h1>On-Premise Active Directory Deployed using Azure Virtual Machines </h1>
For this project, I deployed two virtual machines using Microsoft Azure: One hosting a Windows Server image, and the other hosting a Windows 11 Pro image.The VMs were configured into a Virtual Network and the network settings were configured in order for them to work in unison. I then created 50 users/employees using PowerShell to simulate a small business, as far as numer of users. Finally, I setup Windows Server as a Domain Controller, created and admin user, and did some trouble shooting for a "user" having sign on issues.
